## Description

This Python 3 program analyzes population data from CSV files to calculate age group statistics, population summaries for specified areas, and correlation coefficients.

**Development Notes:**

* This project includes robust error handling to manage file errors, invalid input, and data inconsistencies.
* Key development challenges included handling `TypeError` exceptions during file operations, ensuring case-insensitive comparisons for area codes, and correcting variable naming errors, all of which have been addressed.

## Installation

To run this program, you need Python 3. No additional libraries are required beyond the standard Python library.

## Usage

The program is executed by calling the `main()` function with the following arguments:

* `csvfile_1` (str): Path to the area details CSV file.
* `csvfile_2` (str): Path to the population data CSV file.
* `age` (int): Age to determine the corresponding age group.
* `sa2_1` (str): First SA2 code for analysis.
* `sa2_2` (str): Second SA2 code for analysis.

**Example:**

```python
# Assuming this is called within a larger script
main("area_data.csv", "population_data.csv", 25, "123456789", "987654321")
